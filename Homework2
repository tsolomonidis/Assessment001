// === Homework 2 ===
// You are allocated the task to build a system for the Football League of Elbonia (*).
//
// The system needs to keep track of the game results. For each game the system will 
// keep: the home team, the away team, the score of the home team and the score of the 
// away team.  
//
// A menu will provide the user interface as following: 
//
// 1. Add Game 
// 2. Team Performance 
// 0. Exit 
//
// (1) The system will ask the names of both teams and the goals scored by each team. 
//
// (2) The system will ask the name of a team and then will find and display total wins, 
// losses, and draws.  
//
// (0) The program will terminate. 
//
// Design the classes you will need for this application, then implement the application. 
//
// (*) an imaginary country from the Dilbert (IT related) cartoons.
